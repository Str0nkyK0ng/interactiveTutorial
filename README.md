# the interactive repo to bring you to the interactive website

This repo is an exploration of how to tech HTML/JS in a creative way. It isn't meant to be an all-encompassing guide, but instead a resource to copy and remix. It's main appeal is the fact that you can directly look at the files that make the site run. It's a jumping off point. Please use it in any way that is helpful.

It was made with the intention to be viewed as a website, not a repo.

I see this project as an experiement rather than a conclusion. A step towards a more inclusive way to teach code.
